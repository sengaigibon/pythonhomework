# Check Tic Tac Toe 
# If a game of Tic Tac Toe is represented as a list of lists, like so:
game = [[0, 1, 2], 
        [2, 2, 1], 
        [2, 1, 1]]
# where a 0 means an empty square, a 1 means that player 1 put their token in that space, and a 2 means that player 2 put their token in that space.

# Given a 3 by 3 list of lists that represents a Tic Tac Toe game board, tell me whether anyone has won, and tell me which player won, if any. 
# A Tic Tac Toe win is 3 in a row - either in a row, a column, or a diagonal. 
# Donâ€™t worry about the case where TWO people have won - assume that in every board there will only be one winner.
